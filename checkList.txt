   - [ ] Balance technology progression for gameplay pacing.

5. Diplomacy and Politics:
   - [ ] Design diplomacy mechanics for interaction with other colonies/factions.
   - [ ] Implement negotiation mechanics for treaties and alliances.
   - [ ] Include mechanics for conflict resolution (diplomatic and military).

6. Random Events:
   - [ ] Create a variety of random events (e.g., natural disasters, alien encounters, political upheavals).
   - [ ] Develop mechanics for event triggering and resolution.
   - [ ] Balance event frequency and impact on gameplay.

7. Exploration and Discovery:

8. Colonist Management:
   - [ ] Develop systems for managing colony populations.
   - [ ] Implement mechanics for recruitment, immigration, and reproduction.
   - [ ] Include morale and happiness mechanics affecting productivity and population growth.
   - [ ] Design specializations or traits for colonists affecting colony capabilities.

9. Narrative and Quests:
   - [ ] Create a narrative structure or quest system guiding player progression.
   - [ ] Develop quests with varying objectives and rewards.
   - [ ] Implement quest tracking and completion mechanics.
   - [ ] Ensure quests integrate with gameplay mechanics and world events.

10. User Interface:
